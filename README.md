# Poo-Game
A simple DirectX game taught by "ChiliTomatoNoodle" https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqCJpWy5FohcehaXlCIt8sVBHBFFRVWsx which covers various introductory graphics programming topics.

This repo is effectively an archive.

This repo, is my version of the Poo Game up through the date of creation. This means: I acquired a copy of the Chili Framework (likely
from his wiki) and followed his tutorials on how to implement the Poo game. In many cases, I retained older code what as deprecated
(commented out) by introduction of better methods, and I also included notes to myself.

Moving forward through the remainder of Chili's Beginner Tutorial series (episodes 32 through 51) I will create a local repo branch to
Chili's copy of the Poo Game
https://github.com/planetchili/poo_game
and work from that branch.

This makes more sense than using this one, because he implemented a few changes.
